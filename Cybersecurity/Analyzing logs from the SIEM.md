### **1. Alert Generation**

- **SIEM Data Collection**: The SIEM system collects and aggregates logs and data from multiple sources, such as network devices, firewalls, servers, applications, and other security tools.
- **Correlation and Detection**: SIEM correlates this data and identifies potential threats by applying **rules** and **correlation logic**. These rules are designed to detect suspicious patterns, like failed login attempts, unusual traffic spikes, or potential malware activity.
- **Alert**: When an event matches a rule, the SIEM generates an alert for the SOC analyst to review.

### **2. Initial Triage and Prioritization**

- **Alert Categorization**: The analyst first reviews the alert and assigns it to a specific **category** (e.g., malware, phishing attempt, DDoS, suspicious login) based on the rule that triggered the alert.
- **Severity Assessment**: The analyst assesses the **priority** or **severity** of the alert. SIEMs usually rate alerts on a scale (e.g., low, medium, high) based on factors like the potential impact of the incident and the criticality of the assets involved.
    - **Low severity**: Alerts that might not indicate a direct threat (e.g., one failed login attempt).
    - **High severity**: Alerts that suggest a potential security breach (e.g., multiple failed logins, followed by a successful login from a new IP).
- **False Positive Check**: Not all alerts are valid threats. The analyst needs to quickly determine if the alert is a **false positive** (e.g., a legitimate action flagged as suspicious). This prevents wasting time on harmless activities.
### **3. Investigation and Analysis**

- **Contextual Analysis**: The SOC analyst gathers more context around the alert by examining related logs and events. This may include:
    - Checking **network traffic** for unusual connections.
    - Reviewing **endpoint logs** for changes or malicious behavior.
    - Verifying **user activity** (e.g., did an employee log in from an unusual location?).
    - Looking at historical data for **patterns** of similar activity.
- **Correlating Events**: If the alert seems legitimate, the analyst correlates it with other alerts to get a complete picture. For example, if an alert is triggered for a suspicious login, the analyst might check for any associated malware alerts or unusual file downloads.
- **Enrichment**: Some alerts can be enriched with **threat intelligence** feeds. The analyst checks if the suspicious IPs or domains are known to be associated with malicious activity by referencing external sources like threat intelligence databases.
- **Timeline Construction**: The analyst constructs a **timeline** of events to determine the exact sequence of actions. This helps in understanding how the attack unfolded and which systems were affected.
### **4. Risk Assessment and Escalation**

- **Impact Analysis**: The analyst assesses the potential impact on the organization. Questions to consider:
    - What systems or data were affected?
    - What is the sensitivity of the data involved?
    - Has there been any data exfiltration?
    - Could this be part of a larger attack, like a targeted campaign?
- **Containment Decision**: Based on the analysis, the analyst decides whether the situation requires immediate containment and escalation to a higher-level incident response team. For example, if malware has been detected, immediate containment actions like isolating the infected machine from the network may be required.
- **Escalation**: If the alert is deemed a **serious security incident**, the analyst escalates the case to senior SOC analysts or the incident response team (IRT) for further investigation and remediation.
### **5. Response and Mitigation**

- **Action Plan**: Based on the findings, the SOC team implements a **response plan**. This could involve:
    - **Blocking IPs** or domains associated with the attack.
    - **Isolating affected machines** to prevent the spread of malware.
    - **Forcing password resets** for compromised accounts.
    - **Updating firewall rules** to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Threat Neutralization**: The main goal is to **neutralize the threat** and stop any ongoing malicious activity.
- **Remediation**: The remediation plan might also include **patching vulnerabilities**, removing malware, or restoring systems from backups if necessary.

### **6. Documentation and Reporting**

- **Incident Report**: The analyst documents the entire incident and the steps taken to respond. This report typically includes:
    - A summary of the alert.
    - Steps of the investigation (logs reviewed, correlations made).
    - Actions taken (mitigation, containment, and resolution).
    - Lessons learned and recommendations for future prevention.
- **Communication**: Depending on the severity, this report is shared with IT teams, security leadership, and potentially upper management or other stakeholders.
- **SIEM Rule Tuning**: Based on the findings, the SOC team may adjust the SIEM rules to reduce false positives or improve detection for similar future incidents.
### **7. Post-Incident Review**

- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: After the alert is handled, the SOC team conducts a post-incident review to understand how the alert was handled and identify areas for improvement.
- **Lessons Learned**: The team reviews what could have been done better, such as improving detection rules, refining escalation protocols, or enhancing monitoring capabilities.
- **Rule Refinement**: Based on the incident, the SIEM rules may be **tuned** to detect similar threats more effectively in the future or to reduce unnecessary noise from false positives.
