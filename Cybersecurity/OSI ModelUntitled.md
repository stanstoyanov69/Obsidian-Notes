7 layers Model

### **1. Physical Layer (Layer 1)**

- **What It Does**: This is the **hardware** layer. It’s all about the actual physical connection between devices, like wires, cables, or radio signals (Wi-Fi). It moves raw data (bits: 1s and 0s) across these connections.
- **Example**: Imagine this layer as the **plumbing pipes** that carry water (data) from one place to another.
- **Real-Life Example**: **Ethernet cables**, **fiber-optic cables**, and **Wi-Fi signals** are part of the physical layer.
### **2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**

- **What It Does**: The data link layer makes sure that the data gets to the right device on a local network (like your home Wi-Fi). It breaks data into chunks called **frames** and adds a **MAC address** so each device can tell who the data is coming from and where it's going.
- **Example**: Imagine this layer as **envelopes** with addresses written on them to ensure the right message gets to the right house on the same street.
- **Real-Life Example**: **Switches** and **Network Interface Cards (NICs)** work here, and **MAC addresses** are used to direct the data.
### **3. Network Layer (Layer 3)**

- **What It Does**: This layer is like a **navigator**. It finds the best route for data to travel from one network to another. It uses **IP addresses** to make sure data gets to the correct destination on different networks.
- **Example**: Imagine this layer as a **GPS** guiding a car (data) from one city (network) to another.
- **Real-Life Example**: **Routers** work at this layer, and **IP addresses** help in routing the data.
### **4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)**

- **What It Does**: The transport layer ensures the data is transferred reliably and in the right order. It breaks data into smaller pieces, called **segments**, and makes sure that everything arrives without errors. If anything is missing, it requests for that data to be sent again.
- **Example**: Think of it like **packing a puzzle into multiple boxes** and making sure each box reaches the destination. If a piece is missing, you ask for it to be resent.
- **Real-Life Example**: **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** ensures that when you download a file, it arrives complete and in the correct order.
### **5. Session Layer (Layer 5)**

- **What It Does**: This layer is like the **conversation manager**. It keeps track of the communication between two devices, making sure the connection stays open for as long as needed and closes it when done.
- **Example**: It’s like being on a **phone call**: the session layer keeps the call going until both people hang up.
- **Real-Life Example**: When you are logged into a website, the session layer manages your login session, so the website remembers you are logged in.
### **6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**

- **What It Does**: The presentation layer ensures that the data sent between devices is in the right format and can be understood by the receiving device. It can **encrypt** or **decrypt** data and **translate** different data formats.
- **Example**: Think of it as a **translator** who converts languages so both people can understand each other.
- **Real-Life Example**: When you watch a video online, this layer might **convert** the video file format (like from .mp4 to a format your device can play).
### **7. Application Layer (Layer 7)**

- **What It Does**: This is the layer where humans interact with the network. It’s the **apps and programs** we use to send or receive data, like your web browser, email app, or messaging service.
- **Example**: Imagine this as **ordering food at a restaurant**: this layer is where you place your order (the data you want to send or receive).
- **Real-Life Example**: **Web browsers** (like Chrome or Safari), **email clients** (like Gmail), and **file-sharing programs** (like Google Drive) work at the application layer.
