## How would you handle a zero day attack?

Firstly, I would immediately initiate incident response procedures outlined in the organization's playbook to isolate and contain the zero day attack.Next, I would collaborate closely with cross-functional teams such as IT operations and cybersecurity experts to deploy patches, updates, or workarounds to address the zero day vulnerability.Additionally, I would document the incident details, findings, and response actions taken during and after the zero day attack. This documentation is crucial for post-incident analysis and strengthening future defenses against similar threats.


## How would you manage an incident?
First, I would swiftly investigate the incident by analyzing logs, network traffic, and alerts to determine the scope and impact.Next, I would prioritize containment measures to prevent further damage.Lastly, I emphasize the importance of a robust recovery strategy to restore systems and data.


## Can you explain how you conducted a VA scan across the organization to identify a specific vulnerability on a particular Windows server?
To identify a specific vulnerability on a Windows server, I utilized a combination of automated tools like Nessus and manual checks. By running Nessus scans on all Windows servers, I was able to obtain detailed reports highlighting potential vulnerabilities, including missing patches or misconfigurations.

"Your SIEM tool generates an alert indicating unusual outbound traffic from one of your servers to an external IP address. What steps would you take to investigate and handle the situation?"

**What to focus on**:

- Investigating the alert details in the SIEM tool (e.g., source IP, destination IP, protocols, and ports used).
- Checking if the external IP is known for malicious activity (using threat intelligence sources).
- Correlating the traffic with normal behavior (e.g., scheduled backups or legitimate external communications).
- Reviewing the server’s logs to check for unauthorized access or changes.
- Investigating whether the traffic is part of a **data exfiltration** attempt or a compromised server communicating with a C2 server.
- If malicious, isolating the server and preventing further outbound communication.
- Conducting a **root cause analysis** to understand how the server was compromised.

### **4. Scenario: Ransomware Attack**

**Question**:  
"A user reports that their files have been encrypted, and they are seeing a ransom note on their screen. What is your immediate response, and how do you proceed with the investigation?"

**What to focus on**:

- Isolating the affected machine to prevent the ransomware from spreading.
- Investigating if any network shares or other systems have been affected.
- Collecting evidence, such as ransom note details, file types affected, and any logs showing the ransomware's behavior.
- Checking for indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as suspicious processes, unusual file extensions, or encryption tools running in the background.
- Engaging your **incident response** team to contain and mitigate the attack (e.g., shutting down affected systems, securing backups).
- Determining how the ransomware entered (e.g., phishing, unpatched vulnerability).
- Restoring from backups (if available) and deciding whether to engage law enforcement or pay the ransom (based on company policy).

### **5. Scenario: Brute Force Attack on User Accounts**

**Question**:  
"Your SIEM has detected multiple failed login attempts to several user accounts from an external IP. What actions would you take to investigate and mitigate this?"

**What to focus on**:

- Analyzing the SIEM alerts to identify the affected accounts and whether any were successfully accessed.
- Investigating if this is a **brute-force attack** or **credential stuffing** attempt.
- Blocking the malicious IP addresses or implementing rate limiting on login attempts.
- Forensic investigation: reviewing system and authentication logs to see if unauthorized access occurred.
- Forcing password resets for compromised or targeted accounts and ensuring password policies are strong.
- Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) if it’s not already in place.
- Monitoring for further suspicious activity and updating relevant firewall and IDS/IPS rules.

# **6. Scenario: Suspicious User Behavior**

**Question**:  
"An internal user suddenly starts accessing large volumes of sensitive data that they don’t usually interact with. How would you approach this investigation?"

**What to focus on**:

- Checking if the user’s behavior deviates from their normal activity pattern (e.g., using **UEBA** – User and Entity Behavior Analytics).
- Reviewing access logs and file activity logs to identify what specific data the user is accessing.
- Investigating whether this is a case of **insider threat**, compromised credentials, or just an unusual legitimate activity.
- Conducting an interview with the user (if insider threat is suspected) or the manager to validate the legitimacy of the access.
- If malicious, escalating to the **incident response team** and taking steps to lock out the account or limit access.
- Long-term monitoring of the user’s activity and reviewing internal access policies.

### **7. Scenario: Data Exfiltration Attempt**
