The Windows Event Logs are not text files that can be viewed using a text editor. However, the raw data can be translated into XML using the Windows API. The events in these log files are stored in a proprietary binary format with a .evt or .evtx extension. The log files with the .evtx file extension typically reside in `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs`.

Event logs are crucial for troubleshooting any computer incident and help understand the situation and how to remediate the incident. To get this picture well, you must first understand the format in which the information will be presented. Windows offers a standardized means of relaying this system information.

First, we need to know what elements form event logs in Windows systems. These elements are:

- **System Logs:** Records events associated with the Operating System segments. They may include information about hardware changes, device drivers, system changes, and other activities related to the device.
- **Security Logs:** Records events connected to logon and logoff activities on a device. The system's audit policy specifies the events. The logs are an excellent source for analysts to investigate attempted or successful unauthorized activity.
- **Application Logs**: Records events related to applications installed on a system. The main pieces of information include application errors, events, and warnings.
- **Directory Service Events:** Active Directory changes and activities are recorded in these logs, mainly on domain controllers.
- **File Replication Service Events:** Records events associated with Windows Servers during the sharing of Group Policies and logon scripts to domain controllers, from where they may be accessed by the users through the client servers.
- **DNS Event Logs:** DNS servers use these logs to record domain events and to map out
- **Custom Logs:** Events are logged by applications that require custom data storage. This allows applications to control the log size or attach other parameters, such as ACLs, for security purposes.
