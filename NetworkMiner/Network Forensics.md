**Introduction to Network Forensics**  

Network Forensics is a specific subdomain of the Forensics domain, and it focuses on network traffic investigation. Network Forensics discipline covers the work done to access information transmitted by listening and investigating live and recorded traffic, gathering evidence/artefacts and understanding potential problems.   
  

Briefly, it is the action of recording packets of network traffic and creating investigatable sources and establishing a root–cause analysis of an event. The ultimate goal is to provide sufficient information to detect malicious activities, security breaches, policy/regulation compliance, system health and user behaviour.

  

The investigation process identifies communicated hosts in terms of time, frequency, protocol, application and data.

  

The investigation tries to answer the **5W**;

  

- Who (Source IP and port)
- What (Data/payload)
- Where (Destination IP and port)
- When (Time and data)
- Why (How/What happened)  
    

**Note that** the network evidence capture and investigation process should be systematic. Having enough data and the right timeline capture for a successful network forensics investigation is crucial.

**Network Forensics Use Cases**  

  

The most common network forensics use cases are explained below;

  

- **Network discovery:** Discovering the network to overview connected devices, rogue hosts and network load.   
      
    
- **Packets reassembling:** Reassembling the packets to investigate the traffic flow. This use case is helpful in unencrypted traffic flows.  
      
    
- **Data leakage detection:** Reviewing packet transfer rates for each host and destination address helps detect possible data leakage.   
      
    
- **Anomaly and malicious activity detection:** Reviewing overall network load by focusing on used ports, source and destination addresses, and data helps detect possible malicious activities along with vulnerabilities. This use case covers the correlation of indicators and hypotheses as well.  
      
    
- **Policy/Regulation compliance control:** Reviewing overall network behaviour helps detect policy/regulation compliance.

Sources of Network Forensics Evidence  

  

Capturing proper network traffic requires knowledge and tools. Usually, there is a single chance of gathering the live traffic as evidence. There are multiple evidence resources to gather network forensics data.  

  

- TAPS
- InLine Devices
- SPAN Ports
- Hubs
- Switches
- Routers
- DHCP Servers
- Name Servers
- Authentication Servers
- Firewalls
- Web Proxies
- Central Log Servers
- Logs (IDS/IPS, Application, OS, Device)
