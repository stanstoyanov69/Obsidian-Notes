In some cases, the scan takes a very long time to finish or to produce any output that will be displayed on the screen. Furthermore, sometimes you might be interested in more real-time information about the scan progress. The best way to get more updates about what’s happening is to enable verbose output by adding `-v`. Consider the following terminal output showing the network scan repeated twice. In the first case, we opted for the default output verbosity.


In this room, we learned how to use Nmap to discover live hosts on any network. We also explored the common types of port scans and how we can use Nmap to find service version numbers. We also learned how to control the timing of the scan, and finally, we covered the different formats for saving Nmap scan results.

It is worth noting that it is best to run Nmap with `sudo` privileges so that we can make use of all its features. Running Nmap with local user privileges will still work; however, you should expect many features to be unavailable. You get a minimal portion of Nmap’s power when running it as a local user. For instance, Nmap would automatically use SYN scan (`-sS`) if you are running it with `sudo` privileges and will default to connect scan (`-sT`) if run as a local user. The reason is that crafting certain packets, such as sending a TCP SYN packet, requires root privileges.

Nmap is a very rich tool, and we only covered the most common and essential features in this room. In the [Network Security](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-security) module, four rooms are dedicated exclusively to Nmap. The table below lists most of the options we explained in this room to help you review and remember them.![[Nmap-Cheat-Sheet.pdf]]
