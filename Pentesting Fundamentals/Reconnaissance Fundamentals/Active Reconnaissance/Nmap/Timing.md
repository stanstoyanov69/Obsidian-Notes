Running your scan at its normal speed might trigger an IDS or other security solutions. It is reasonable to control how fast a scan should go. Nmap gives you six timing templates, and the names say it all: paranoid (0), sneaky (1), polite (2), normal (3), aggressive (4), and insane (5). You can pick the timing template by its name or number. For example, you can add `-T0` (or `-T 0`) or `-T paranoid` to opt for the slowest timing.

In the Nmap scans below, we launch a SYN scan targeting the 100 most common TCP ports, `nmap -sS 10.10.123.90 -F`. We repeated the scan with different timings: T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4. In our lab setup, Nmap took different amounts of time to scan the 100 ports. The table below should give you an idea, but you will get different results depending on the network setup and target system.
