Vulnerability Management is the process of identifying security flaws and vulnerabilities in software, reporting on these so they can be fixed, with a goal of reducing the risk and impact of cyber-attacks. This is a very important aspect of network and computer security, as it works to reduce the attack surface, a term used to describe the number of potential security flaws a malicious actor could exploit to cause harm to an organization. The process includes the following steps:

- **Identification –** Using vulnerability scanners, manual techniques, and asset discovery methods to identify and record systems (such as servers, desktops, laptops, mobiles, IoT devices), along with any security issues they have, with scores based on different factors (see [CVSS scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System)).
- **Reporting –** Reporting these issues to appropriate stakeholders (such as system owners) so they can be addressed, and eventually resolved.
- **Remediation –** Having the security issues fixed by the system owner or technical owner so that the security flaw is no longer present. Different methods can be used to remediate vulnerabilities, such as security patches, reconfigurations, or mitigating controls.
- **Reassessment –** Scanning or manually checking to ensure the security issues have been successfully fixed.

This is a cyclic process, so assets should routinely be scanned, especially after major changes. Identifying and fixing vulnerabilities quickly means malicious actors have less time to discover and exploit them.


Vulnerabilities are announced constantly, and most of them affect software that is used on a mass scale. 50 new vulnerabilities were detected **every day** on average in 2017 [1]. Examples include security flaws in Google Chrome, the Windows operating system, and other common programs such as Adobe Flash Player, and Adobe Shockwave Player.

Being able to keep on top of these issues, and make sure products are patched as soon as possible (usually after testing, to ensure there are no unwanted effects from the patch), means that hackers have less time to attempt exploitation.

By ensuring internet-facing systems are secure, it’s harder for attackers to get in, and by ensuring internal systems are secure, it’s harder for attackers to move around, and complete the actions they want to, such as privilege escalation or information harvesting.

**Threat Intelligence Analyst**

Receiving and reporting on intelligence about newly released vulnerabilities, or vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited in the wild, and by which threat actors. Intelligence Analysts will usually have access to commercial tools that allow them to observe exploitation activity on a global scale, as well as underground discussions about vulnerabilities, helping the Vulnerability Analysts to prioritize which issues need to be fixed first.

**Vulnerability Analyst**

Identifying, reporting on, and helping to remediate vulnerable assets to harden the estate and reduce risk from cyber-attacks. Daily tasks include vulnerability scanning, analyzing results, performing manual checks, reporting on security flaws, and keeping up-to-date with the latest publicly available news regarding vulnerabilities, as well as receiving threat intelligence reports from Intelligence Analysts.

**Incident Responder**

Knowledge about vulnerabilities, and how to deal with compromises as a result of successful exploitation is key in knowing how to respond in the most effective way.

**Penetration Tester / Red Teamer**

Knowing how to identify and scan for vulnerabilities and security flaws is key to this role, allowing you to exploit systems and gain access for security purposes, reporting on these so that Vulnerability Analysts can work with stakeholders to get the systems remediated.
