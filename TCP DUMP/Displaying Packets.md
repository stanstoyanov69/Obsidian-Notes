Tcpdump is a rich program with many options to customize how the packets are printed and displayed. We have selected to cover the following five options:

- `-q`: Quick output; print brief packet information
- `-e`: Print the link-level header
- `-A`: Show packet data in ASCII
- `-xx`: Show packet data in hexadecimal format, referred to as hex
- `-X`: Show packet headers and data in hex and ASCII

To demonstrate how the above options manipulate the output, we will first display two captured packets without using any additional arguments.![[packet display.png]]
