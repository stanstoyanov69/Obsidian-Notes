To use the Burp Suite Proxy, we need to configure our local web browser to redirect traffic through Burp Suite. In this task, we will focus on configuring the proxy using the FoxyProxy extension in Firefox.

**Create Burp Proxy Configuration:** In the FoxyProxy options pop-up, click the **Options** button. This will open a new browser tab with the FoxyProxy configurations. Click the **Add** button to create a new proxy configuration.![[Pasted image 20241120143635.png]]

**Add Proxy Details:** On the "Add Proxy" page, fill in the following values:

- Title: `Burp` (or any preferred name)
- Proxy IP: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `8080`
**Remember the following:**

- When the proxy configuration is active, and the intercept is switched on in Burp Suite, your browser will hang whenever you make a request.
- Be cautious not to leave the intercept switched on unintentionally, as it can prevent your browser from making any requests.
- Right-clicking on a request in Burp Suite allows you to perform various actions, such as forwarding, dropping, sending to other tools, or selecting options from the right-click menu.
