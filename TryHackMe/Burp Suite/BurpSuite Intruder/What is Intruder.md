Intruder is Burp Suite's built-in fuzzing tool that allows for automated request modification and repetitive testing with variations in input values. By using a captured request (often from the Proxy module), Intruder can send multiple requests with slightly altered values based on user-defined configurations. It serves various purposes, such as brute-forcing login forms by substituting username and password fields with values from a wordlist or performing fuzzing attacks using wordlists to test subdirectories, endpoints, or virtual hosts. Intruder's functionality is comparable to command-line tools like **Wfuzz** or **ffuf**.

However, it's important to note that while Intruder can be used with Burp Community Edition, it is rate-limited, significantly reducing its speed compared to Burp Professional. This limitation often leads security practitioners to rely on other tools for fuzzing and brute-forcing. Nonetheless, Intruder remains a valuable tool and is worth learning how to use it effectively.
