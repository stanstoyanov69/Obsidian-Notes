Let's discuss each of these areas below.

## The Operations Area

This is a practical and comprehensive repository of all the diverse operations that CyberChef is equipped to perform. These operations are meticulously categorized, offering users convenient access to various capabilities. Users can utilize the search feature to locate specific operations quickly, enhancing their efficiency and productivity.

Below are some operations you might use throughout your cyber security journey.

## The Recipe Area

This is considered as the heart of the tool. In this area, you can seamlessly select, arrange, and fine-tune operations to suit your needs. This is where you take control, defining each operation's arguments and options precisely and purposefully. The recipe area is a designated space to select and arrange specific operations and then define their respective arguments and options to customize their behaviour further. In the recipe area, you can drag the operations you want to use and specify arguments and options.

Features include the following:

- `Save recipe`: This feature allows the user to save selected operations.
- `Load recipe`: Allows the user to load previously saved recipes.
- `Clear Recipe`: This feature will enable users to clear the chosen recipe during usage.

These can be found in the highlighted icons below:

The bottom part of the image above is the `BAKE!` button. This processes the data with the given recipe.

Additionally, you can tick the `Auto Bake` checkbox. This feature allows users to automatically cook using the selected recipe without manually clicking `BAKE!` every time.

## Input Area

The input area provides a user-friendly space where you can easily input text or files by pasting, typing, or dragging them to perform operations.
