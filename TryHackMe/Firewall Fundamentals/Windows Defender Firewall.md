### Windows Defender Firewall

Windows Defender is a built-in firewall introduced by Microsoft in the Windows OS. This firewall contains all the basic functionality for creating, allowing, or denying specific programs or creating customized rules. This task is designed to cover some of the essential components of the Windows Defender Firewall, which you can utilize to restrict your system’s incoming and outgoing network traffic. To open this firewall, you have to open the Windows search and type "Windows Defender Firewall."

The Windows Defender Firewall’s home page shows the "Network Profiles" and the available options. This is the main dashboard with all the options for the firewall.![[Pasted image 20241128103153.png]]### Network Profiles

There are two available network profiles. Windows firewall determines your current network based on Network Location Awareness (NLA) and applies that profile firewall settings for you. We can have different firewall settings for each of them.

1. **Private networks:** This includes the firewall configurations to apply when connected to our home network.
2. **Guest or public networks:** This includes the firewall configurations to apply when connected to a public or untrusted network like coffee shops, restaurants, or similar. For example, when connecting to public networks, you can configure firewall settings to block all incoming network connections and allow only some outgoing connections that are essential for you. These settings will apply to the public network profile and will not be implemented when you are in your private home network.

To allow/disallow any application in any of your network profiles, click on the option (highlighted as 1 in the screenshot). This will take you to the page listing all the apps and features installed in your system. You can checkmark the ones you want to allow in any of your network profiles or uncheck those if not needed. Windows Defender Firewall is turned on by default. However, if you want to turn it on/off, you can click on the option (highlighted as 2 in the screenshot). This will take you to the settings for both of your network profiles. Rather than completely turning it off, which Microsoft doesn’t recommend, you can also block all incoming connections. You can also click on "Restore Defaults" (highlighted as 3 in the screenshot) from the main dashboard anytime to restore all the firewall's default settings.
### Custom Rules

Windows Defender Firewall also allows you to create custom rules for your network to allow/disallow specific traffic as needed. Let’s create a custom rule to block all outgoing traffic on HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). After creating this rule, we will be unable to browse any website on the Internet as the websites are working on port 80 or 443, which we will be blocking.
