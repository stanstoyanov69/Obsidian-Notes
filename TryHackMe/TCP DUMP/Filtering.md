### Filtering by Host

Let’s say you are only interested in IP packets exchanged with your network printer or a specific game server. You can easily limit the captured packets to this host using `host IP` or `host HOSTNAME`. In the terminal below, we capture all the packets exchanged with `example.com` and save them to `http.pcap`. It is important to note that capturing packets requires you to be logged-in as `root` or to use `sudo`.

### Filtering by Port

If you want to capture all DNS traffic, you can limit the captured packets to those on `port 53`. Remember that DNS uses UDP and TCP ports 53 by default. In the following example, we can see all the DNS queries read by our network card. The terminal below shows two DNS queries: the first query requests the IPv4 address used by example.org, while the second requests the IPv6 address associated with example.org.

### Filtering by Protocol

The final type of filtering we will cover is filtering by protocol. You can limit your packet capture to a specific protocol; examples include: `ip`, `ip6`, `udp`, `tcp`, and `icmp`. In the example below, we limit our packet capture to ICMP packets. We can see an ICMP echo request and reply, which is a possible indication that someone is running the `ping` command. There is also an ICMP time exceeded; this might be due to running the `traceroute` command (as explained in the [Networking Essentials](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/networkingessentials) room).
