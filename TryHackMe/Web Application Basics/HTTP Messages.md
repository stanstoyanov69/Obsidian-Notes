HTTP messages are packets of data exchanged between a user (the client) and the web server. These messages are very important for understanding how web applications work because they show how users' requests and the server's responses are communicated.

Imagine an example of an HTTP Request and an HTTP Response, where you can see key parts like the method, URL, headers, and status codes. These are what make the client-server interaction possible.
There are two types of HTTP messages:

- **HTTP Requests**: Sent by the user to trigger actions on the web application.
- **HTTP Responses**: Sent by the server in response to the user’s request.![[Pasted image 20241207143814.png]]
