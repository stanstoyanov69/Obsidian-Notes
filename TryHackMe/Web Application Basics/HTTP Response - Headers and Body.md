### Response Headers

When a web server responds to an HTTP request, it includes **HTTP response headers**, which are basically key-value pairs. These headers provide important info about the response and tell the client (usually the browser) how to handle it.

Picture an example of an HTTP response with the headers highlighted. Key headers like `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, and `Date` give us important details about the response the server sends back.![[Pasted image 20241207150414.png]]
