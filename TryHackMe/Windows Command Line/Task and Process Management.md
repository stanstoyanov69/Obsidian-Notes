You must be familiar with MS Windows Task Manager and might be familiar with killing non-responsive processes. Let’s discover how to achieve a similar functionality using the command line.

We can list the running processes using `tasklist`.![[task.png]]Some filtering is helpful because the output is expected to be very long. You can check all available filters by displaying the help page using `tasklist /?`. Let’s say that we want to search for tasks related to `sshd.exe`, we can do that with the command `tasklist /FI "imagename eq sshd.exe"`. Note that `/FI` is used to set the filter _image name equals_ `sshd.exe`![[task2.png]]With the process ID (PID) known, we can terminate any task using `taskkill /PID target_pid`. For example, if we want to kill the process with PID `4567`, we would issue the command `taskkill /PID 4567`.
