From the official Microsoft [page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.4): _“PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework.”_

PowerShell is a powerful tool from Microsoft designed for task automation and configuration management. It combines a command-line interface and a scripting language built on the .NET framework. Unlike older text-based command-line tools, PowerShell is object-oriented, which means it can handle complex data types and interact with system components more effectively. Initially exclusive to Windows, PowerShell has lately expanded to support macOS and Linux, making it a versatile option for IT professionals across different operating systems.
