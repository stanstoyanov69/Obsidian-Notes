Originating from the military, a “Kill Chain” is a term used to explain the various stages of an attack. In the realm of cybersecurity, a “Kill Chain” is used to describe the methodology/path attackers such as hackers or APTs use to approach and intrude a target.

For example, an attacker scanning, exploiting a web vulnerability, and escalating privileges will be a “Kill Chain”. We will come to explain these stages in much further detail later in this room.  

The objective is to understand an attacker's “Kill Chain” so that defensive measures can be put in place to either pre-emptively protect a system or disrupt an attacker's attempt.
