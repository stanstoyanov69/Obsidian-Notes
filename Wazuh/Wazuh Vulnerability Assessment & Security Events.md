Wazuh’s Vulnerability Assessment module is a powerful tool that can be used to periodically scan an agent's operating system for installed applications and their version numbers.

Once this information has been gathered, it is sent back to the Wazuh server and compared against a database of CVEs to discover potential vulnerabilities. For example, the agent in the screenshot below has a version of Vim that is vulnerable to **CVE-2019-12735**.![[Pasted image 20241120092805.png]]

Wazuh is capable of testing an agent's configuration against certain rulesets to check for compliance. However, out of the box, it is arguably sensitive. Take, for example, this Linux host running the Wazuh agent. There have been a total of 769 events occurring that the system performs as part of its daily maintenance![[Pasted image 20241120092948.png]]
