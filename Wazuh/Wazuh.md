Created in 2015, [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) is an open-source, freely available and extensive EDR solution. It can be used in all scales of environments. Wazuh operates on a management and agent module. Simply, a device is dedicated to running Wazuh named a manager, where Wazuh operates on a management and agent model where the manager is responsible for managing agents installed on the devices you’d like to monitor. Let's look at this model in the diagram below:

Welcome to a room showcasing the capabilities of the Wazuh EDR software solution. In this room, you can expect to learn the following things:

- What is an EDR and why are they useful solutions
- Where an EDR like Wazuh is used
- Accessing Wazuh
- Navigating Wazuh
- Learning about Wazuh rules and alerts
- Digesting logs to view specific events on devices including Linux and Windows
- How you can extend Wazuh using plugins and its API

Firstly, let's understand what EDR solutions are exactly. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) are a series of tools and applications that monitor devices for an activity that could indicate a threat or security breach. These tools and applications have features that include:

- Auditing a device for common vulnerabilities
- Proactively monitoring a device for suspicious activity such as unauthorised logins, brute-force attacks or privilege escalations
- Visualising complex data and events into neat and trendy graphs
- Recording a device's normal operating behaviour to help with detecting anomalies
