The command `tracert target_name` traces the network route traversed to reach the target. Without getting into more details, it expects the routers on the path to notify us if they drop a packet because its time-to-live (TTL) has reached zero. The terminal output below shows that we passed through 15 routers before reaching our target.![[4.png]]

One networking command worth knowing is `nslookup`. It looks up a host or domain and returns its IP address. The syntax `nslookup example.com` will look up `example.com` using the default name server; however, `nslookup example.com 1.1.1.1` will use the name server `one.one.one.one`. The terminal below shows the output of both commands. The results are identical; however, you can see that the answers were retrieved from different name servers.
